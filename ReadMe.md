I have made a app in which
 sales person would be able to login to mobile app.
- start his day by selecting list of distributors  going to visit for today
- able to capture new online order.
- be able to tally work
- be able to see a list of my todays orders when sales person going to end his day.
Wheras  an Organization head would be able to
- login to mobile app
- see daily, weekly, monthly and yearly sales.
